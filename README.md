# Piolín Tech — WRO Future Engineers 2025

## Introduction  
We are **Piolín Tech**, a passionate robotics team competing in the **2025 WRO Future Engineers** category. This is our first year in this category, and we are proud to present our kid, Piolin: a fully autonomous vehicle controlled by a LEGO **EV3** brick, programmed using **Python** and **LEGO Mindstorms**. This repository documents our entire journey, including development, testing, and final results.

## 🧠 Abstract  
Our solution is an **autonomous EV3-based vehicle**, fully programmed in **Python** and **LEGO Mindstorms**. The EV3 brick manages:
- Motor control  
- Sensor integration  
- Decision-making logic  
- Obstacle avoidance and traffic sign detection

We use a **color sensor** to detect traffic signs, an **ultrasonic sensor** for obstacle detection, and **motor encoders** for precise movement. Piolin is designed with accuracy and simplicity in mind, using path planning and sensor feedback to adapt in real time during the challenge.

## 🙏 Special Thanks  

We are extremely grateful to:
- Our families, for supporting us (and letting us stay past our usual time just to finish Piolin 🛠️)
- Our coach, Teacher Hanna, for guidance
- Everyone who tested, reviewed, or encouraged our project along the way :) It means the world to us!
