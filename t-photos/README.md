These pictures show us the members of Piolín Tech: Mia, Sebastian, and Christian! :) We are three young students who stand proudly behind our robot, Piolín. Although we are not professional engineers, we are passionate about robotics and always eager to learn more. Our knowledge is still developing, but we work hard to improve our skills every day. We enjoy building, solving problems, and coming up with creative ideas as a team. What drives us is our enthusiasm, dedication, and love for robotics. For us, Piolín Tech is more than just a project, it’s a shared experience that we built on curiosity, teamwork, and a desire to grow.
