# Piol√≠n Tech - Project Overview

## 1. Introduction to Piol√≠n Tech
**Piol√≠n Tech** is an autonomous robot developed by the Panamanian üáµüá¶ team **Piol√≠n Tech** for the 2025 World Robot Olympiad (WRO). Our project participates in the **Future Engineers** category. The primary goal of Piol√≠n Tech is to integrate advanced robotics principles, including sensor fusion, real-time data processing, and autonomous decision-making, to navigate and complete challenges efficiently, representing Panama in an international robotics arena.  

The robot is designed to **autonomously navigate a predefined circuit**, detect obstacles, and adapt its path in real time. Its architecture combines a **Raspberry Pi 5** for advanced visual processing, an **EV3 Brick** for motor and sensor control, and an array of ultrasonic and color sensors to support navigation and obstacle management.  

## 2. Main Components

| Component | Function |
|-----------|---------|
| **DC Motors** | Provides rear-wheel drive (RWD) propulsion. |
| **Wheel Encoders** | Measures wheel rotations to calculate distance traveled and precise movement. |
| **Servo Motor** | Controls front-wheel steering for precise turns. |
| **Nexigo Camera** | Connected to a Raspberry Pi 5, responsible for visual detection, color recognition, and obstacle identification. |
| **Ultrasonic Sensors (3)** | Two side sensors and one front sensor measure distances in real-time for collision avoidance and alignment with walls. |
| **MPU Gyroscope with PID Control** | Provides continuous orientation data to maintain stable and accurate trajectories. |
| **Color Sensor** | Detects colored lines on the track to signal turns or special maneuvers. |

> Each component has its own detailed documentation, covering calibration, common errors, logic, and integration with the robot.  

## 3. Main Operational Workflow

The robot's operation is structured into three main phases:

### 3.1 Initialization Phase
- **Power-Up, Self-Checks, and Calibration:** Upon startup, Piol√≠n Tech verifies that all sensors and actuators are functional and calibrates the MPU gyroscope for orientation. If any sensor fails to initialize, the program halts.
- **Ready State:** An LED indicator signals when the robot is ready, and operation begins with a button press.

### 3.2 Autonomous Navigation Phase
This is the core phase where the robot continuously adapts to its environment:

- **Orientation Correction (Continuous):**  
  - The MPU-6050 provides live orientation data.  
  - A PID controller corrects rotational drift, ensuring straight trajectories.  
  - Yaw corrections are applied differently depending on the challenge type (parallel distance to walls or rear wall alignment).  

- **Obstacle Detection and Evasion (Conditional):**  
  - The Nexigo camera constantly scans the path.  
  - If an obstacle is detected in the field of view:  
    - **Evasion Maneuver:** The robot turns to avoid the object until the path is clear.  
    - **Trajectory Re-acquisition:** Side ultrasonic sensors assist in re-centering the robot on its intended path while the gyroscope PID controller maintains orientation.  

### 3.3 Completion Phase
- **End of Laps:** After completing the required number of laps, Piol√≠n Tech transitions to the completion phase.  
- **Parking Maneuver:** The robot executes a pre-planned maneuver to reach the designated parking zone, concluding the challenge.
