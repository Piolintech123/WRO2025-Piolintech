# Piol√≠n Tech - Project Overview

## 1. Introduction to Piol√≠n Tech
**Piol√≠n Tech** is an autonomous robot developed by the Panamanian üáµüá¶ team **Piol√≠n Tech** for the 2025 World Robot Olympiad (WRO). Our project participates in the **Future Engineers** category. The primary goal of Piol√≠n Tech is to integrate advanced robotics principles, including sensor fusion, real-time data processing, and autonomous decision-making, to navigate and complete challenges efficiently, representing Panama in an international robotics arena.  

The robot is designed to **autonomously navigate a predefined circuit**, detect obstacles, and adapt its path in real time. Its architecture combines a **Raspberry Pi 5** for visual processing, an **EV3 Brick** for motor and sensor control, and an array of ultrasonic and color sensors to support navigation and obstacle management.  

## 2. Main Components

| Component | Function |
|-----------|---------|
| **DC Motors** | Rear-wheel drive (RWD) propulsion. |
| **Wheel Encoders** | Measures wheel rotations for distance and precise movement. |
| **Servo Motor** | Controls front-wheel steering. |
| **Nexigo Camera** | Visual detection, color recognition, obstacle identification (Raspberry Pi 5). |
| **Ultrasonic Sensors (3)** | Two sides + one front, for collision avoidance and wall alignment. |
| **MPU Gyroscope with PID Control** | Maintains stable orientation and straight trajectory. |
| **Color Sensor** | Detects track lines for turns or maneuvers. |
