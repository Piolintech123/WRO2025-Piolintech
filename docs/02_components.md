## LEGO Color Sensor
- **Quantity:** 1  
- **Voltage:** 4.3–5V (powered via EV3 Brick port)  
- **Description:** The LEGO Color Sensor detects the color of surfaces or objects directly in front of it. It can be used for obstacle recognition, simple visual cues, or track detection if programmed. The sensor communicates directly with the EV3 Brick, which processes the data for autonomous decision-making.  
- **Features:** Measures reflected and ambient light, detects standard colors (e.g., red, green, blue, yellow, black, white), compatible with EV3 programming environments (LEGO Mindstorms Python, Pybricks), fast response time for real-time robotics applications.

## LEGO EV3 Brick
- **Quantity:** 1  
- **Voltage:** 10V 
- **Description:** The EV3 Brick functions as the primary actuator controller of the robot. It executes commands from onboard programs or the Raspberry Pi, controls motors, reads sensor inputs, and coordinates all low-level robot actions.  
- **Features:** ARM9 processor, 64KB RAM, 16MB flash memory, 6 sensor input ports, 4 motor output ports, Bluetooth and USB connectivity, supports programming in MicroPython, EV3-G, and other languages.

## Ultrasonic Sensors
### Front Ultrasonic Sensor (S1)
- **Quantity:** 1  
- **Voltage:** 4.5–7V (EV3 powered)  
- **Description:** Detects obstacles or walls directly ahead of the robot. Provides distance measurements to prevent collisions and enable safe navigation.  
- **Features:** Range 0–250 cm, high sampling rate, adjustable detection thresholds, supports both continuous and triggered measurement modes.

### Right Ultrasonic Sensor (S2) & Left Ultrasonic Sensor (S3)
- **Quantity:** 2  
- **Voltage:** 4.5–7V (EV3 powered)  
- **Description:** Mounted on the sides, these sensors help maintain alignment with walls or track boundaries and assist in path correction during turns or evasive maneuvers.  
- **Features:** Same as front ultrasonic, supports simultaneous readings for improved side-to-side positioning.
