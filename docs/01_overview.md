# PiolÃ­n Tech - Project Overview

## 1. Introduction to PiolÃ­n 
**PiolÃ­n** is an autonomous robot developed by the Panamanian ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦ team **PiolÃ­n Tech** for the 2025 World Robot Olympiad (WRO). Our project participates in the **Future Engineers** category. The primary goal of PiolÃ­n Tech is to integrate advanced robotics principles, including sensor fusion, real-time data processing, and autonomous decision-making, to navigate and complete challenges efficiently, representing Panama in an international robotics arena.  

The robot is designed to **autonomously navigate a predefined circuit**, detect obstacles, and adapt its path in real time. Its architecture combines a **Raspberry Pi 5** for visual processing, an **EV3 Brick** for motor and sensor control, and an array of ultrasonic and color sensors to support navigation and obstacle management.  

## 2. Main Components
| Component | EV3 Port / Interface | Function |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Rear Motor** | A | Rear-mounted, drives rear wheels. |
| **Front Motor** | B | Front-mounted, controls front wheels/steering. |
| **Front Ultrasonic Sensor** | S1 | Front-facing object detection. |
| **Right Ultrasonic Sensor** | S2 | Side-facing object detection. |
| **Left Ultrasonic Sensor** | S3 | Side-facing object detection. |
| **Camera (Nexigo)** | 0 (via Raspberry Pi 5) | Visual detection, color recognition, and obstacle identification. |
| **Color Sensor** | (EV3 Port, if used) | Detects track lines for turns or maneuvers. |

> Each component has detailed documentation covering calibration, common errors, and integration with the robot.

## 4. Main Operational Workflow
## 4. Open Challenge Operational Workflow

### 4.1 Initialization Phase
#### 4.1.1 Power-Up and Self-Checks
- EV3 verifies the following:
  - Rear Motor (A) and Front Motor (B) functionality.
  - Ultrasonic sensors: Front (S1), Right (S2), Left (S3).
- Color sensor is calibrated to detect track lines correctly.

#### 4.1.2 Ready State
- LED indicator signals the robot is ready.
- Operation begins when the start button is pressed.

### 4.2 Autonomous Navigation Phase
#### 4.2.1 Path Following
- Robot moves forward along the track.
- Side ultrasonic sensors (S2 and S3) maintain safe distance from walls or track boundaries.
- Color sensor detects lines or markers to indicate turns.

#### 4.2.2 Obstacle / Wall Detection
- Front ultrasonic sensor (S1) monitors for walls or obstacles directly ahead.
- Pre-programmed maneuvers adjust the robotâ€™s trajectory to avoid collisions using side and front ultrasonic readings.

#### 4.2.3 Adaptive Turning
- Turns are triggered by color markers on the track.
- Side ultrasonics ensure proper alignment during and after turns.

### 4.3 Completion Phase
#### 4.3.1 Lap Counting
- The robot tracks completed laps using the color sensor and pre-defined markers.

#### 4.3.2 Parking Maneuver
- After completing all required laps, the robot navigates to the designated parking zone.

#### 4.3.3 End State
- Robot stops automatically, signaling the completion of the Open Challenge.
