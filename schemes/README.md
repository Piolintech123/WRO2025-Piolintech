Electromechanical diagrams
====

This electromechanical diagram shows the drivetrain configuration of our EV3-based robot, designed using a four-wheel chassis with two independent motors. One motor is mounted centrally between the rear wheels, and the second is aligned between the front wheels. Weâ€™re employing a free-wheel traction system, where the motors are responsible for propulsion while the unpowered wheels, the ones on front, provide support and stability.

This layout seeks to optimize balance and maneuverability, it is designed that way to help us to experiment with turning dynamics and load distribution. The design might seem straightforward, but it helps us witb engineering iterations addressing alignment drift, inconsistent motor calibration, and physical wear from repeated field testing.
