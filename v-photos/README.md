Vehicle's photos
====

These photos show our robot from different angles: front, back, top, and sides. Each view helps explain how the robot is built and where the main components are located, such as the wheels, motors, sensors, and cables. We have included both a 3D rendering of the model and real-life photos of the physical robot. This allows for a clear comparison between the design phase and the final build, giving a more complete and accurate understanding of our robotâ€™s structure. Both these models were crafted carefully accurate by the team-members.
