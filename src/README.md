## Project Structure

### 1. Open Challenge
- **Code:** [open_code1.py](round_1/open_code1.py)  
  Contains the program used in the Open Challenge (Round 1), implementing reactive navigation with ultrasonic sensors and color sensors.  

### 2. Obstacle Challenge
- **Code:** [obstacles_code2.py](round_2/obstacles_code2.py)  
  Contains the program used in the Obstacle Challenge (Round 2), including obstacle detection and avoidance logic.  

### 3. Round 1 - Explanation
- **Documentation:** [round_1_exp.md](round_1/round_1_exp.md)  
  Detailed explanation of the robot’s behavior, sensor usage, and control logic during the Open Challenge.  

### 4. Round 2 - Explanation
- **Documentation:** [round_2_exp.md](round_2/round_2_exp.md)  
  Detailed explanation of the robot’s behavior, sensor usage, and control logic during the Obstacle Challenge.

## Notes
- All code is written in **Python** using **Pybricks MicroPython** for the EV3 Brick.  
- Make sure to read the corresponding round explanation (`round_1_exp.md` or `round_2_exp.md`) before running the code to understand operational logic and safety considerations.
